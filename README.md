The chanllange I did was: `Criminals`.

Link to the site: `http://200.136.213.109/`

Some screenshots included in the repository.

In this research I found serveral links,

which helped me a lot, 

I will mention those when I will organize this repo and write the write-up,

hope it will be soon.

Thanks to A.R, who was my partner to solve this challange,

was an honor and really fun!


- `Criminals.ipynb` is the main notebook
- `sqli.py` was used to run queries quicker with threads
